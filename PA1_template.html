<p>We can see that both the mean and median increased in value, when the NA data were replaced by mean of the interval. This is expected, as we are replacing zero values with positive values. A large number of rows were NA (2304 out of 17568 data-points). Thus the effect is a significant shift in the frequency of steps close to zero, to close to the mean.</p>
